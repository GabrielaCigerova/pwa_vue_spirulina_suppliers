# Learning Vue.js (PWA / SPA)
This project is a practical application where I learned to code using Vue.js, focusing on building a Progressive Web Application (PWA) and a Single Page Application (SPA). Throughout the development process, I explored key concepts such as routing, state management, and responsive design, all while creating an interactive map to showcase spirulina suppliers.
